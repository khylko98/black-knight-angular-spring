  "mainText": ["Semero and Austin exchanged a glance before Austin turned to Arvanka and spoke up, \"Well, we don't mind staying in the wagon if you're kind enough to let us. And if it's not too much trouble, could you show us to the guest rooms? I'm feeling a bit tired after our journey.\"", "Arvanka nodded and gestured for them to follow her. As they walked through the magical wagon, Austin asked, \"Is there a magical tub with magical boiling water anywhere around here? I could really use a good soak.\"", "Arvanka raised an eyebrow, \"I'm afraid there's nothing like that here, but not everything appears to everyone.\"", "Semero and Austin exchanged with misunderstanding a glance.", "Arvanka finally brought Semero and Austin to two adjacent doors at the very end of the magical corridor and said: \"Here you can rest.\" Austin silently chose a room for himself and went in quietly slamming the door behind him. Semero and Arvanka were left alone in the corridor."],

  "talkOptionResult": ["He turns around to talk to Arvanka, but he finds that she has disappeared, leaving him alone in the corridor. Semero looks around for a moment, confused and disoriented, before he realizes that he is really in a magical place. He shakes his head, takes a deep breath, and then opens the door to his own room, ready to rest and recover from his difficult journey so far.", "Semero opens the door to his assigned room and is struck by a sense of familiarity. It is an exact replica of the room in the castle where he grew up, down to the smallest detail. Walls are lined with the same blue damask fabric, and the tall windows with their delicate lace curtains are identical. Bed is the same ornate four-poster bed he used to sleep in as a child, with crisp white linens and a plush blue velvet coverlet.", "In one corner of the room, there is a small writing desk made of dark wood, just like the one in his childhood room. On the desk, there is a quill pen and a stack of parchment paper, along with a book of poetry by a famous poet that Semero has always admired.", "As he walks around the room, prince feels a strange mixture of comfort and unease. He cannot believe that this room, which he has seen in years, has been recreated so perfectly. He wonders who could have designed this place with such precision and care.", "Despite his confusion, Semero feels a sense of relief as he sits down on the edge of the bed. He is tired from his journey, and the familiarity of this room brings him a sense of peace.", "He collapsed onto the soft mattress, his body sinking into the blankets and pillows. He let out a deep sigh of relief as he closed his eyes and felt the fatigue wash over him.", "Within moments, Semero had fallen into a deep. His body was completely relaxed, and he didn't stir as the hours passed. Room was silent, and the only sound was the gentle rustle of the curtains in the breeze. Semero was lost in a peaceful slumber, completely oblivious to the world around him."]
