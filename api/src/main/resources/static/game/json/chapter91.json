  "mainText": ["Semero stood at the edge of valley, gazing in awe at bleak and desolate scene before him. Valley was surrounded by imposing, craggy mountains, their peaks lost in the swirling mist and clouds that shrouded area. He could feel a chill run down his spine, as if very air around him was tinged with some dark magic.", "As he looked down into valley, his heart sank. Once lush and verdant trees had all been burned to cinders, their twisted and blackened remains jutting up from ground like crooked fingers. Ground itself was barren and lifeless, strewn with ash and debris, as if some great and terrible fire had consumed everything in its path.", "Despite overwhelming sense of despair that clung to this place, Semero couldn't help but feel drawn to it. In the center of valley, he could see silhouette of a huge castle, its walls crumbling and dilapidated, and a single tower with a bell at top. He knew he had to get closer.", "As he made his way towards castle, he stumbled upon remnants of burned villages. Stench of charred wood and flesh filled his nostrils, and he had to fight urge to gag. Every step he took seemed to crunch on bones and ash, and he couldn't help but wonder what sort of hellish nightmare had taken place here.", "Finally, after what seemed like hours of trudging through desolate wasteland, he arrived at castle gates. Once imposing walls were now little more than a pile of rubble, and drawbridge had long since rotted away. Semero cautiously made his way inside, his footsteps echoing loudly off stone walls.", "As he wandered through castle, he couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. Air was thick with a sense of foreboding, and he could feel eyes watching him from shadows. But he pressed on, his curiosity driving him deeper into the ruins.", "Eventually, he reached tower at the center of castle. Bell at the top had long since didn't ringing, but he could hear faint sound of something scratching at walls from within. With a deep breath, he began to climb the spiral staircase, his hand gripping rusted railings as he ascended higher and higher.", "Finally, he reached top, his heart pounding in his chest. He peered through the dusty windows, his eyes widening at sight before him. Stars shone brightly in the sky, casting a soft light over the valley below. But something else caught his eye as well - a flicker of movement in the distance, something that shouldn't have been there.", "Semero's heart was pounding in his chest as he made his way to tower bell. He knew that if dragon was truly nearby, this would be his best chance to lure it to castle. His fingers closed around rough rope, feeling its frayed fibers digging into his skin. He took a deep breath, steadying himself for what was to come.", "With a firm tug, Semero pulled on rope, and bell began to ring. Sound echoed through the empty valley, a deep and resonant peal that seemed to fill the air. At first, there was no response, and Semero began to worry that his plan had failed.", "But then, he heard faint sound of movement in the distance, a rustling of leaves and crackling of twigs underfoot. His heart quickened, and he rang bell again, more urgently this time. Sound grew louder, and he could sense dragon drawing nearer.", "With each ring of bell, Semero could feel dragon's approach growing closer, until finally, he caught sight of it through the tower window. Its scales glinted in the morning light, and Semero could see fire in its eyes as it focused on castle.", "For a moment, Semero was frozen with fear. Dragon was enormous, far larger than any he had ever seen before. But then, he remembered why he had come here. He steeled himself, bracing his feet and pulling on rope with all his might.", "Bell's ringing grew louder and more frenzied, and dragon's gaze fixed on castle. It let out a roar that shook very foundations oftower, and Semero could feel heat of its breath washing over him.", "But he refused to give up. He kept ringing bell, over and over again, until finally, dragon began to circle castle, its massive wings casting shadows across scorched earth.", "With a sense of satisfaction, Semero realized that he had succeeded. Dragon had been lured to the castle, and now, he had a chance to face it head-on. He took a deep breath, readying himself for the battle to come. Whatever happened next, he knew that he had come too far to turn back now.", "Semero's heart was pounding in his chest as he raced down winding staircase of the tower. Sound of dragon's approach was growing louder and louder, and he knew that he had to get out of there before it was too late.", "Roof of tower exploded, as if it had been hit by a fierce storm. And there, in the midst of debris, was dragon. Semero's eyes widened in terror as he realized that it was even more massive up close than he had imagined.", "Bell, which had been ringing just moments before, now hung precariously in the air above him, threatening to fall at any moment. Semero barely managed to dodge out of its path, leaping up to the wall and racing down the stairs as quickly as he could.", "But even as he descended, he could feel heat of dragon's breath on his back, could hear its massive wings beating air. And then, as he looked up, he saw something that chilled him to the bone.", "An eerie blue flame was burning just steps above him, threatening to engulf him in its deadly embrace. Semero gritted his teeth and ran even faster, determined to make it out of the tower alive.", "He heard a sound that made his blood run cold. Wall of the staircase ahead of him crumbled, and terrible sharp claws burst through the wreckage. Semero dodged and slipped, narrowly avoiding being struck by dragon's lethal attack.", "With a surge of adrenaline, he pushed himself harder, racing down the stairs as fast as his legs could carry him. He knew that he had to get out of the tower before dragon caught up with him. And so, he kept running, his breath coming in ragged gasps, until finally, he burst through the door.", "Semero's heart was pounding as he raced through the corridor, his mind racing even faster than his feet. He knew that he had to find a way to defeat dragon, but he had no idea where to start. He looked down at his belt, hoping to find his trusty sword, but it was nowhere to be found. He had left it back in the cave by the arch, and now he was defenseless.", "As he turned a corner, he heard a deafening roar, and then corridor shook as if hit by a massive force. Semero turned around just in time to see walls of the corridor crumble underforce of the dragon's paw. He shuddered at thought of what would have happened to him if he had been in the way of that attack.", "With his heart in his throat, Semero kept running, searching desperately for a way out of castle. But no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't come up with a plan. His mind was clouded with fear and panic, and he felt as if he was running in circles.", "As he ran, he stumbled over charred remains of what looked like knights' armor, and he couldn't help but wonder how many brave men had lost their lives in this place. But he knew that he couldn't afford to think about that now. He had to focus on finding a way out and defeating dragon.", "Despite his growing sense of despair, Semero kept running, hoping that he would find a way out before it was too late. Semero's heart raced as he turned corner and saw dead end ahead of him. He knew that he had to act fast, or he would be trapped. As he approached hole in wall, he could hear sound of dragon's wings flapping overhead, and he knew that he was running out of time.", "Just as he reached edge of hole, he looked up and saw dragon swooping down towards him. Dragon's eyes locked onto Semero, and Semero froze in terror. He watched in horror as dragon opened its massive jaws, and a torrent of flames shot out towards him.", "Semero closed his eyes in fear, but suddenly opened them when he realized that he was falling. Someone had pushed him.", "Semero fell into the cold water of the palace pond, his body shocked by the suddenness of the plunge. As he struggled to regain his bearings, he felt a strong hand grip his arm and pull him up to surface. Gasping for breath, he looked up to see his savior - a tall, muscular man with big sword. It was Austin Jorgall.", "\"Thank you,\" Semero managed to say, shivering as cold water clung to his clothes.", "Before he could question him further, a deafening roar echoed through palace grounds, sending chills down his spine.", "Without hesitation, Austin grabbed Semero's arm and pulled him towards nearest exit. They ran through dark hallways and twisted corridors, dodging fallen debris and avoiding gaping holes in the floor. Finally, they burst into a small courtyard, surrounded by crumbling walls and overgrown vines.", "Austin reached into his belt and pulled out the gleaming blade.", "\"Yours, I believe,\" he said, handing it to Semero with a wry smile.", "\"Yes, I lost him in dark tonnel,\" said Semero.", "As they ducked behind a nearby statue, Semero couldn't help but ask question on everyone's mind. \"What are we going to do about dragon?\"", "Austin's expression turned grim. \"I'll have to think of something.\"", "Semero and Austin moved stealthily from statue to statue, their eyes glued to the sky. Dragon was circling overhead, its scales gleaming in sunlight. Semero's heart raced with excitement and fear - he knew that he needed to obtain dragon's blood in order to save Arvanka, but he also knew that it would be no easy feat.", "\"I need dragon blood, Austin,\" Semero whispered urgently.", "Austin nodded grimly. \"For Arvanka. Yes, I know. But it won't be easy to get her.\"", "As they made their way towards a columned passage, Semero's mind raced with ideas. He knew that they needed to lure dragon down to the ground somehow, but he couldn't think of a way to do it without putting themselves in danger.", "Finally, they reached entrance to another part of castle and paused at doorway, their eyes fixed on the sky. \"As long as dragon is flying, we can't get to it,\" Semero muttered.", "Austin rubbed his stubbled chin thoughtfully. \"We need a distraction,\" he said finally. \"Something big enough to catch dragon's attention and draw it down to the ground.\"", "Semero nodded, his mind racing with possibilities. They would need to think fast if they were to stand any chance of obtaining dragon's blood and saving Arvanka from certain death.", "Austin's sudden suggestion took Semero by surprise. \"We need to go to the tower. There is no other way out,\" he declared.", "Semero was taken aback. \"I was there. Dragon blew top of tower.\"", "\"There's a good view,\" Austin replied cryptically, grabbing Semero's arm and pulling him along.", "They ran through winding corridors of castle, their footsteps echoing off crumbling walls. Finally, they reached foot of tower and began to climb, their breath coming in ragged gasps.", "As they ascended winding staircase, Semero's mind raced with questions. What was Austin's plan? How would they get dragon to come to them? But he had little time to ponder, as they soon emerged onto rooftop, dawn sun casting a warm glow across landscape.", "Austin wasted no time in drawing his sword and positioning himself at edge of tower, blade glinting in sunlight. Semero watched in confusion as he realized Austin's plan - to use reflection of sun to catch dragon's attention and draw it down to tower.", "And it worked. Dragon caught sight of flashing blade and immediately zeroed in on tower, spitting flames at structure with deadly accuracy.", "Semero and Austin dived for cover under fallen bell, narrowly avoiding dragon's fiery breath. As they lay there, catching their breath and waiting for dragon to move on, Semero couldn't help but feel a sense of awe and admiration for Austin's quick thinking and bravery. He knew that they still had a long way to go, but for first time in a long time, he felt a glimmer of hope.", "Austin scrambled to his feet and ran towards edge of tower, his sword held high. \"Come on, you big bastard!\" he shouted, waving blade in air. \"You want a piece of me? Come and get it!\"", "Dragon, hearing Austin's taunts, let out a deafening roar and swooped down towards tower. Austin leapt back just in time, narrowly avoiding dragon's talons as they scraped stone ledge.", "\"Fly here!\" he called gesturing towards spot where he stood.", "Semero struggled to his feet and took up his sword, trying to steady his breathing as he prepared to face beast. But as he took a step forward, floor beneath him gave way, and he tumbled down a flight of steps, landing in a crumpled heap at bottom.", "All air was knocked out of his lungs, and for a moment, he lay there gasping, his vision swimming. But then he remembered why he was there, and he struggled to his feet, his sword clutched tightly in his hand.", "With a deep breath, Semero began to climb stairs once again, determined to face dragon and claim blood that he needed to save Arvanka.", "Semero stands up and sees a dragon approaching Austin with its mouth. Austin holding a sword in front of it while leaning on a part of destroyed wall. Dragon seems to be preparing to strike at Austin, who is standing nearby. Semero realizes that he needs to act quickly to save his friend.", "Creature approached Austin, its massive mouth looming over him, but man holding a sword in front of it. In that moment, Semero was faced with a choice - to shout out and distract dragon, or to charge at it with his sword."],
  "swordOption": ["Semero squeezed hilt of his sword tighter and rushed at dragon, trying to thrust sword between its scales."],
  "swordOptionResult": ["Dragon turned around its attention towards Semero, and in that moment, Austin seized opportunity. Leaning forward, he thrust his blade into dragon's eye with all his might. Dragon roared in agony as it attempted to pull blade out with its sharp claws, but it was too late. Sword had inflicted a mortal wound, causing blood to pour out of dragon's eye.", "As dragon struggled to free itself from sword, bloodied weapon slipped from its grasp and clattered to ground. But before Austin could celebrate his victory, dragon plunged its deadly claws into his body, piercing him through. Semero was struck with horror, unable to move or do anything to help his friend.", "Dragon lifted Austin's limp body in one of its paws, preparing to take off into the distance. Semero was left alone, powerless to stop dragon from escaping with Austin's lifeless body.", "Semero's world had come crashing down around him as he knelt there. Destruction that lay before him was overwhelming, and he could not hold back tears that flowed freely down his cheeks. He felt his body tremble with emotion as he tried to gather his thoughts, to come up with some way to make things right. But what could he do? It seemed that all was lost.", "And then he remembered vial. Precious vial of purple liquid that he had been carrying with him all this time, one that held key to saving Arvanka. He reached into his pocket, his fingers trembling as he searched for the small container. It was still there, thank gods. But it was not enough. He needed blood of dragon to complete  medicine, to make it potent enough to save Arvanka's life.", "With a sense of determination that surprised him, Semero crawled over to where Austin's blade lay, still dripping with dragon's blood. He carefully brought out vial and held it beneath blade, letting a few drops of crimson liquid fall into it. He breathed a sigh of relief.", "With the medicine now complete, Semero knew that he could go back. Go back to Arvanka, to girl he loved."],
