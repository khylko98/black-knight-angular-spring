    "Before he could ask any questions, Moon Maiden stands up and says, \"It's time for you to go back now, Semero. But remember, you are always safe here.\" She gives Semero a warm hug, and he feels a sense of love and gratitude wash over him. Girl steps back, and Semero watches as she walks away, disappearing into the sky.",
    "Semero wakes up, feeling refreshed. Memories of the dream stay with him, filling him with a sense of peace and comfort. He sits up and looks around the room, feeling grateful for the rest and the dream that has touched his soul.",
    "Semero, still a bit groggy from his sleep, slowly got up from the bed and stretched his arms, trying to shake off the last remnants of his dream. Suddenly, there was a loud knock on the door, making him jump in surprise. \"Who is there?\" he asked cautiously, expecting an answer.",
    "Silence. Semero shrugged and walked towards the door, opening it carefully. To his surprise, he found himself face to face with a small, greenish creature with pointed ears - a goblin. Before Semero could react, the goblin flew straight at him, causing him to stumble backwards.",
    "With a loud thud, Semero managed to throw the goblin off of him and watched in shock as it scurried away. At that moment, he heard laughter coming from the doorway and turned to see Arvanka standing there, a wide grin on her face.",
    "\"I see you've met one of our little friends,\" she chuckled, gesturing towards the retreating goblin. \"Don't worry, they're harmless. They just like to play sometimes.\"",
    "Semero couldn't help but smile at Arvanka's words, feeling a sense of relief wash over him. He realized that he was safe here, in this magical place, surrounded by new friends and wonders beyond his imagination.",
    "Arvanka invites Semero to refresh himself, \"Would you like to freshen up, Semero? We have plenty of water from the enchanted springs and some fruits from the garden to snack on.\"",
    "Semero agrees and they make their way to tree at the center of wagon. As they approach tree, Semero notices the tablecloth laid out on the ground, which is covered with a variety of delicious-looking foods. There are platters of exotic fruits, some of which Semero has never seen before, arranged in a colorful and appetizing display.",
    "Next to fruits, there are bowls of steaming soups and stews that seem to change color and texture with each passing moment. There are also plates of crispy fried meat, roasted vegetables, and freshly baked bread. The aroma of food fills the air, making Semero's mouth water.",
    "Arvanka points to a pitcher of water on the table, \"Help yourself to some enchanted water, Semero. It will leave you feeling refreshed and rejuvenated.\" She then sits down on a cushion near the tree and gestures for Semero to join her.",
    "Semero and Arvanka began to help themselves to breakfast, taking small portions of the various dishes laid out on the tablecloth. As they ate, Semero asked, \"Where's Austin?\"",
    "Arvanka replied, \"He went out to talk to the wizard about the way forward.\"",
    "Semero nodded."
