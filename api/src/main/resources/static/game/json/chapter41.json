    "Semero finds himself on the shore of a small pond. Night sky is dotted with bright stars and a huge, bright moon hangs above. Air is cool, but not cold, and the water in the pond is calm and still. Semero raises his head, and his eyes widen in amazement. From the sky, walking through the air, descends a beautiful girl in a heavenly, airy, translucent dress. She has long, purple hair, big, bright eyes, and bare feet. As she descends, she continues to walk on the surface of the water of the pond, approaching Semero.",
    "This girl stops in front of Semero and looks at him with a gentle smile. Semero feels his heart racing, and his mouth goes dry. He tries to speak, but no words come out. Girl reaches out her hand and touches Semero's cheek. He feels a warm, comforting energy flow through him, and he begins to relax. Girl speaks, and her voice is like a soothing melody. \"You are safe here, Semero. You are always safe here.\"",
    "Semero feels a sense of peace and comfort wash over him. He looks into the girl's eyes and sees kindness, wisdom, and something else he cannot quite name. She takes his hand and leads him to the edge of the pond. They sit down together, and Semero feels a sense of trust and ease with her that he has never felt before.",
    "\"I'm Moon Maiden,\" she appeared to him.",
    "\"I'm Semero,\" he appeared to her.",
    "\"Where are you going, Semero?\" she asked.",
    "\"I'm going to kill the dragon,\" Semero replied with determination.",
    "\"It's not enough to go alone,\" Moon Maiden said with concern. \"You need friends on the way, Semero.\"",
    "Semero was taken aback by her words."
