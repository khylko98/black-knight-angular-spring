  "mainText": ["Despite the warning by mystery man, prince was resolved to press on, come what may.", "Semero urged Dandelion forward, crossing the narrow bridge with caution. The wooden planks creaked under the horse's hooves as they made their way to the other side. On this side of the river, the shore was overgrown with reeds, and the air was filled with the croaking of frogs and the buzzing of mosquitoes. The smell of damp earth hung heavily in the air, and the sound of rushing water filled Semero's ears as the river flowed beneath them.", "The road ahead of Semero made sharp turns like a whip, leading him through a area dotted with small clusters of trees. Small clusters of trees dotted the horizon, their branches twisted and gnarled as if they had been warped by some unseen force. Prince rode on, occasionally glancing back uneasily to see if the stranger wasn't following him. The warning of the mysterious figure still echoed in his mind, but Semero was determined to complete his quest and rid the kingdom of the nightmare dragon.", "As he rode through the barren landscape, the young prince couldn't help but feel a sense of foreboding. The wind howled mournfully, stirring up clouds of dust and sand that swirled around him. Occasionally, he would catch sight of movement in the corners of his eyes, but when he turned to look, there was nothing there.", "Despite the emptiness of the landscape, Semero couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He periodically looked back uneasily, half-expecting to see the mysterious stranger lurking somewhere in the shadows. But there was no sign of anyone else on the road.", "Despite the eerie silence, Semero pressed on, his eyes fixed on the horizon. He hoping that the road ahead would lead him to safety.", "The prince dismounted from Dandelion, patting the horse's nose with a grateful smile. He took a deep breath of the fresh evening air, tinged with the scent of pine and wood smoke. Semero then reached into his saddlebags and pulled out a bedroll, spreading it out on the ground beneath a large oak tree. As he settled down for the night, he gazed up at the stars twinkling above, feeling a sense of both excitement and fear for the journey ahead.", "He then took out some bread and cheese from his saddlebags, and took a small sip from his water skin, being careful to ration his supplies. After his meal, he sat in quiet contemplation, listening to the crackling of the campfire he had built. The sound of the nearby stream lulled him into a peaceful state, and he eventually drifted off to sleep, with Dandelion standing guard nearby.", "However, in the middle of the night, Semero was awoken by a rustling in the bushes nearby. He sat up quickly, his hand reaching for his sword. As he peered into the darkness, he saw the glowing eyes of a wolf staring back at him. The prince quickly stood up and drew his sword, ready to defend himself and Dandelion.", "But the wolf didn't attack. Instead, it let out a mournful howl and ran off into the night. Semero couldn't shake off the feeling of unease that lingered in the air, and he spent the rest of the night restlessly shifting in and out of sleep, constantly vigilant for any other signs of danger.", "Dandelion became restless, sensing an ominous presence that seemed to be lurking in the shadows. It neighed anxiously, tugging at the leash, as if trying to break free from an invisible hold.", "Semero, concerned about the horse's behavior, approached Dandelion and tried to calm him down. It was then that he saw a nightmarish figure emerge from under one of the jagged stones. The figure was shrouded in a ragged cloak with a hood pulled low over its face, and its bony paw extended toward the frightened prince.", "Dandelion, sensing danger, managed to break free from the leash and bolted into the darkness. Semero stood frozen in fear as the figure continued to approach him, its ragged cloak billowing in the wind. The prince was now alone, facing an unknown and terrifying threat in the middle of the dark and eerie valley.", "As the nightmarish figures emerged from the darkness, Semero could see that they were not entirely human. Their twisted limbs and ragged clothing gave them an otherworldly appearance, and their eyes glinted with a strange, malevolent light. The prince felt a chill run down his spine as he realized that he was completely surrounded.", "The creatures began to move in on him, their bony fingers reaching out to grab him. Semero was frozen in place, unable to move or even scream. It was as if he had been trapped in a terrible nightmare.", "But then, out of nowhere, the stranger appeared. He moved with a grace and speed that were almost supernatural, his sword flashing in the moonlight. With a swift and deadly stroke, he cut through the arm of one of the creatures, causing it to howl in pain.", "As the stranger fought off the nightmarish creatures, one of them managed to jump on his back. The Semero, frozen in fear, faced a difficult choice."],
  "swordOption": ["He could try to reach for his sword, which was lying next to the saddlebags."],
  "swordOptionResult": ["Semero quickly made his decision, running towards the bags to grab his sword. With the sword in hand, he charged towards the figures and plunged the blade into the one that had jumped on the stranger's back. The creature let out a blood-curdling scream and vanished into thin air, leaving behind a green blood on the prince's blade.", "The stranger was a skilled fighter, his sword flashing in the dark as he cut down the nightmarish figures one by one. Semero also tried to attack one of them, but he suddenly felt a sharp pain and began to feel very weak. The world swam before his eyes and the young man collapsed to the ground, losing consciousness."],
  "talkOption": ["He shout to stranger turn around for warn him of the creature under his back."],
  "talkOptionResult": ["Semero shouted to the stranger: \"Behind you!\" as he saw the creature creeping up on him. The stranger swiftly turned around and managed to dodge the creature's first attack. He then lunged forward with his sword, trying to pierce the creature's heart. ", "However, the another creature moved to Semero, and managed to grab the prince by the throat and lift him off the ground with its feet. The creature's grip was too strong, and the young prince was slowly losing consciousness. Suddenly, Semero felt a sharp pain in his head, and the world went black."]
